    <p>Dear Peter</p>

    <p><strong>Re: Sales Assistant Vacancy (vacancy number 40568)</strong></p>

    <p>I am writing to apply for the position of Sales Assistant at ABC Clothing Ltd, which was advertised on Trade Me on 14 February 2013.</p>

    <p>I have enclosed my CV to support my application. It shows that I would bring important skills to the position, including:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>time management and strong organisational skills</li>
        <li>high level customer service and friendly relationship management</li>
        <li>cash handling and sales ability</li>
        <li>motivation and dedication</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As a Sales Assistant at a busy shoe store, I have been able to build up a strong foundation of customer service skills. Through this on-hand experience, I am now looking for a new challenge in my career. The Sales Assistant role with ABC Clothing Ltd would offer me a chance to grow and further develop my retail career.</p>
